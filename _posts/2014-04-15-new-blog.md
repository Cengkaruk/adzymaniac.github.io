Completed move my last blog (using Ghost) to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Writing post in Markdown file, it's feel like writing on Ghost.

Publish new post with git commit and push. Like a hacker :))
This first post currently in version 1.0.0. Look the version if you want to know this blog updated or not.

Thanks to Github for this free blog hosting.
